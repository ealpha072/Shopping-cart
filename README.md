# shopping-cart
## Live demo --->  https://ealpha072.github.io/shopping-cart/

In this project, i make a store that sells tv sets and add a working cart that displays selected goods.The user can increase the quantity and remove it from the cart. The cart totals are updated with change in quantity to give a running balance. The puchase button when clicked, opens a modal that prompts the user to confirm purchase. Once the user confirms, he is alerted of successfull purchase and his cart cleared. This project is an improved version of the online phone store as it incoporates a cart system.

## Techs used:
  * HTML-JS-BOOTSTRAP
  
## Things learnt:
  * Application logic
  * Bootstrap Modals
  
In the next similar application, i will create elements in raw form instead of using document.createElement() every time.
